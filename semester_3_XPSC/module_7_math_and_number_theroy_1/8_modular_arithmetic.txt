Modular arithmetic:

    1. Modular Addition
    2. Modular Subtraction
    3. Modular Multiplication
    4. Modular Division (we will not learn this here)

let mod be 10^9

1. Modular Addition:
    (a + b) % mod
    (a%mod + b%mod) % mod 
both are same but 2nd one is best

1. Modular Subtraction:
    (a - b) % mod
    (a%mod - b%mod) % mod 
both are same but 2nd one is best

1. Modular Multiplication:
    (a * b) % mod
    (a%mod * b%mod) % mod 
both are same but 2nd one is best

for three variables
    (a * b * c) % mod
    ((a%mod * b%mod) * c%mod) %mod
